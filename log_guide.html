<h2>Just How Bad am I? A Guide to DPS & Warcraft Logs Pt. 1</h2>
<h5>by: M. A. Boa</h5>
 
<p>This guide is intended for everyone in the raid who wants to increase their DPS by being prepared, looking at logs, and making adjustments. This is geared towards DPS, but healers and tanks should also be able to find this information useful. Our raid has some really good DPS. A few of us parse very high for our specs/ilvl, but we <b>ALL</b> have room to improve. Contrary to popular belief, we don’t top meters simply by ignoring mechanics (though we’re all guilty sometimes). For me, it’s a three step process:<p>

<ol>
<li><p><b>Itemization/Stat Priority/Consumables</b> – I am constantly optimizing my gear to meet any soft-caps / breakpoints my class has. If I get a big upgrade, but that drops my crit below 25% unbuffed, I do anything I can to get it back up to or as close to that cap as I can. This includes food buffs, gems, enchants, and even at times pieces of gear that might otherwise not be my Best in Slot. I have a rather in-depth knowledge of my class…not everyone does, so what should you do? <a href="http://askmrrobot.com">askmrrobot.com</a> | <a href="http://icy-veins.com">icy-veins.com</a></p>
<p>Come prepared for the raid. Bring enough flasks, potions, runes and food as you’ll need. There is no excuse to not be flasked, well-fed, and using two potions on every pull. Occassionally I’ll forget to come prepared, it happens. If this happens to you, ask someone in the raid to help you out for the night. Plenty of raiders bring extra consumables and will gladly share. <div class="well">It has happened on more than one occasion that Varos or I have forgotten to buy extra potions/runes, and have completed trades during fights without missing a GCD…for these tactics see the advanced guide by V. A. Ros entitled <em>“How to do enough damage so that no one questions why you don’t have a mic”</em>.</div></p></li>
<br/>

<li><b>Rotations/Talents and Cooldown Usage</b> – Everyone should go to <a href="http://icy-veins.com">icy-veins.com</a> and know what their single-target, cleave, and AOE rotations are. It’s very important to be using the right spells/attacks at the right time to maximize your DPS. Also know what talents/glyphs to use on a specific fight. Tomes are cheap for a reason, you are intended to be swapping out talents and glyphs for each fight if needed. Equally as important is knowing when to pop your cooldowns. Become familiar with the fights and when we pop raid cooldowns. Be familiar with the fights to know when a phase will be happening soon that we need high burst DPS to help kill the boss (Gorefiend). I receive a lot of criticism for topping meters during Execute phases, but I know that’s when I am capable of doing the most damage, and is often when boss mechanics get harder/stronger and the boss needs to die before we do. I often save cooldowns for these phases (if they weren’t needed soon before) to maximize my damage…you should know when you are capable of putting out the most damage and use your cooldowns accordingly. <b>EVERYONE</b> should be pre-potting prior to the pull (often you’ll also use your first round of cooldowns on or near the pull as well) and using the second potion during a high-DPS phase of the fight.</li>
<br/>

<li><b>Execution</b> – Pun intended. It’s one thing to know your rotation, it’s another to execute it. Some classes rotations are easier than others. Some classes get screwed by movement more than others. Deal with it, and do the most damage you can. Practice makes perfect, there are training dummies in your garrisons for a reason. It’s not particularly hard to hit my Bladestorm keybind. Making sure I’m enraged for a full 6 seconds prior to Bladestorm, without losing any uptime and otherwise screwing up my rotation is a different story. Using addons like WeakAuras and TellMeWhen to track buffs, cooldowns, procs, etc. will help you master your rotations and do more DPS.</li>
</ol>
<br/>

 
<h3>Why Should You Care?</h3>
 
<p>Doing <b>Big Dick DPS</b> helps us kill the boss, it’s that simple. The more effective damage we do shortens phases and fights, and takes a lot of pressure off healers and tanks – making them more efficient as well. As we progress the fights get more difficult, and tighter on DPS. This is especially true if we want to progress into Mythic (I do). We should be doing everything we can to make sure the fights go as smoothly as they can so that we can progress at a reasonable pace.</p>
 
<p><em>"But Marsh, class/spec XYZ sucks on (insert fight here)"</em>…I don’t care. As much as I hate when Varos beats me on a fight, I don’t compare myself to Varos, I compare myself to others of my spec/ilvl and so should you. It might be true that your spec is low on the totem pole for a particular fight but that’s most likely not the reason your DPS sucks, it’s a YOU problem. Each raid tier has fights where some classes will be stronger than others. What we should be concerned with is if we are playing our class/spec correctly for each fight and doing as much damage as we can. With that said, all of us competing to do more damage than the other DPS in the raid only helps us kill the boss.*</p>
 
<div class="well"><b>*NOTE:</b> The goal should always be to do as much damage as you can WHILE correctly dealing with mechanics. (Dead DPS deal zero damage).</div>


<h3>Warcraft Logs</h3>
 
<p>So how can you tell if you’re performing well? Easy, we log. Each raid night, Brisp or somebody else logs all of our attempts, and uploads them to <a href="http://warcraftlogs.com">warcraftlogs.com</a>.<div class="well">If DH is in the raid, he will also log to Mr. Robot...their infographics can be very helpful as well, but I prefer Warcraft Logs</div> You can view our logs by searching for Dragon Knight. Links to recent raid logs also exist on the site in the left sidebar. You can also search for character specific logs by searching your character name. The quickest way to see how well you did on a fight is to go to the log for the kill, and click on the Rankings tab on the top right of the page:
</p>

</div>
<br/>
<p>What you want to look at in this view is the right-most column “Bracket %”. Warcraft Logs compares your parse to all others who are your spec, and in the ilvl bracket that you were when it was logged. There can be a lot of variance here…for example if you died <em>(not an excuse)</em> and remained dead for any large portion of the fight, you are likely going to have low numbers. Other factors of variance include set-bonuses, fight length, raid size, strategies etc. However, those differences might be why you are in the 70th percentile and not the 75th. They are not the difference between grey and orange. It’s also worth noting not to take too small of a sample size. The above image has Varos in the 31st bracket percentile on this fight. That is an anomaly as he is consistently much higher <div class="well">Wootman had performance anxiety, which for him is the norm</div> You should look at as much data as is available to see how you are performing overall and on certain fights. If you are consistently below average then you are doing something wrong <em>(you are likely doing many things wrong)</em>. If you are doing very well on Hellfire Council, but poorly on Iron Reaver then you may have mastered your cleave rotation/talents, but your single-target needs work.
 
Warcraft Logs has too much information to go over all of it but one of the best ways I find to improve is the default analyze tab. From that tab, clicking on your (or others) name will take you to your damage breakdown for that fight:</p>

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <a class="gif" href="http://i.imgur.com/1Y6rrKw.jpg"><img class="gif embed-responsive-item" src="http://i.imgur.com/1Y6rrKw.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<br/>
 
<p>From this view you can analyze your damage by how much each spell did, and when. If I find that I’m not performing as well as I would like on a given fight, I’ll view the logs of the top warriors for that encounter and compare their breakdowns to mine. To do this I’ll go to the menu at the very top left of the site: Zones -> HFC -> Gorefiend -> Rankings <em>(Choosing Statistics instead of Rankings is also a great way to see how your spec does vs. other specs BTW)</em>. From that Rankings menu you’ll have some additional filtering to do. Select the raid difficulty, class, and ilvl bracket you are in to get a view of the top parses for your class/ilvl:</p>
 
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <a class="gif" href="http://i.imgur.com/zi5y9BB.jpg"><img class="gif embed-responsive-item" src="http://i.imgur.com/zi5y9BB.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<br/>
 
<div class="well">Other than seeing that your browser knows you recently purchased a gift for your girlfriend</div>From this view, you can click on the character names to get their damage breakdowns. There is a compare tab where you can compare your log to others in the same window by copy/pasting the URL, which is very neat but unnecessary. From the comparisons, you’ll likely find that you are using complete different talents than many of the top parsers. You might find out that you have a core rotational issue. You might even find out in order to be competitive you want to be a completely different spec on that fight.
 
Coming to the raid prepared, with knowledge of your class and WILLING to make adjustments if you notice you are under-performing will go a long way to helping the raid progress through Heroic and Mythic content. Icy Veins class guides, Mr. Robot, and Warcraft Logs are excellent tools to help you in this process.
