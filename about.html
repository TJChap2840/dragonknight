  <p>Dragon Knight (est. 2004) is a raiding guild on Boulderfist. We raid Tuesday through Thursday 7:30pm to 10pm server time. We are always looking for new members and will speak to anybody interested in joining our raid team. We do not have any spots to fill immediately but are looking for active dedicated raiders to push Mythic. If you prove to be on consistenly during raid time and do quality DPS, you have a very good chance to move into our 20 man team.</p>

  <p>We are currently 13/13h and <b>4/13m</b>. We aren't a hardcore guild but we do try to push through content quickly without getting overly stressed about the rate at which we are going.</p>

  <p>You can reach out to anybody in the list below on Boulderfist:</p>
  <li>Dragonheart</li>
  <li>Bigchap</li>
  <li>Tresane</li>
  <li>Damitus</li>
  <li>Crians</li>
