  <p>Dragon Knight (est. 2004) is a raiding guild on Boulderfist. We raid Tuesday through Thursday 7:30pm to 10pm server time. We are always looking for new members and will speak to anybody interested in joining our raid team. Right now we have an immediate need for <b>ranged DPS</b> (excluding Hunters) and a <b>Disc Priest</b>.</p>

  <p>We are currently 13/13h and 1/13m. We aren't a hardcore guild but we do try to push through content quickly without getting overly stressed about the rate at which we are going.</p>
