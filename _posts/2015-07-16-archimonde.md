<h4>Mannoroth Down</h4>
We killed Mannoroth tonight after only two attempts. We spent probably a quarter of our second attempt talking about what was the best strat to use after the inevitable wipe on that attempt. Sweet irony.

<h4>4/13 Heroic</h4>
After Mannoroth we steam rolled through 4 Heroic bosses. We are going to start focusing on Heroic progression along with skipping past the lower level Normal bosses (via the Gorefiend quest) to be able to get to Archimonde faster.

<h4>Archimonde</h4>
With that said, we have a raid event on Monday to kill Archimonde. Please study up on the boss. You have plenty of time and there is an embedded video below to help you with that.
