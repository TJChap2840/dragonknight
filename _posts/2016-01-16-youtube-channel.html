<h3>Hearthstone Tournament</h3>
Due to some availability issues, we started the our first Hearthstone tournament a few days early. Since then, we've had a few more matches played. I'll make a more formal announcement when we get closed to the final matches of the tournament as to when the will be played. 

<h3>Youtube Channel</h3>
I have created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8BXVlTC8SiL3Y_NIXQpnzg"><b>Youtube channel</b></a> to help consolidate the recordings of the tournament matches. You can find them all at the link provided or on the new social button added to the websites navbar. The youtube channel won't be just for the Hearthstone tournament. Any fun Dragon Knight content going forward will be added to that channel so check back regularly.

<h3>Honorable Kill Event</h3>
It's a good time to announce our next event now that the Hearthstone tournament has started. 
The event will be held on the Bonus Honor weekend and will have one simple rule. Get the most honorable kills of the course of that weekend and be crowned champion. To make sure everybody is on even footing, contestants current HK amount will be recorded as the event starts. When the event is over, contestants HK amount will be recorded again and the biggest difference between the two will get the win. I'll put an event up for that weekend for you guys to sign up on.

<h3>Mythic Gorefiend CAN SUCK IT</h3>
As our raid time was coming to an end on Tuesday night, the raid team decided to rally together and try one more pull. Everything clicked in that pull and we were able to down Kilrogg. Great job everybody. We took a strat and made it work for our raid team and it paid off. Very well done.

On Wednesday, we started Gorefiend (aka "the guild killed"). Talk about a total nightmare. That fight is designed so well. Everybody has to be absolutely perfect with mechanics to kill this boss. Please continue researching to fight so that we can go into the next progression night much better off.
