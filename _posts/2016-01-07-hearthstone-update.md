<h3>Hearthstone Update</h3>
The deadline to sign up for the tournament is this Saturday. Sometime on Sunday I will create the bracket and all players will be required to give me their decks and entry fee. You can see a preview of the bracket below along with a link to the information page.

<h3>Other events</h3>
My goal with this tournament is to lay the foundation for more events. The ones that immediately came to mind (due to being WoW based) were duel tournaments and pet battle tournaments. Unfortunately, these are hard to spectate and may not turn out to be very fun. 

The idea is to create an atmosphere in our guild where people can take part in things outside of just the normal dungeon/raid/PvP groups. I'd like to hear the ideas you guys may have. Message me through normal communication channels if you have anything you'd like to bring to my attention.

<h3>Did somebody say Shenanigans?</h3>
Something great happened in the raid this week and we were lucky to have Dam recording at the time. Enjoy this awesome clip.
