<h5>More Resources</h5>
I've completed <a href="/learn_your_class/">Part 2</a> of Marsh's amazing <a href="/log_guide/">guide</a>. This guide continues with the Warcraft Logs theme and goes over some additional tools that it Warcraft Logs provides. Both of these guides should provide plenty of information to get you on track. 

I've also added a mostly unfinished page for Weak Auras. If you have any interestingn Weak Aura strings to share, please send them to me. If you have any requests, you can send them my way.
