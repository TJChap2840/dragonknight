<em>Get it guys? SALT of Socrethar??....I'll see myself out...</em>

<h5>We're 6 of 13 heroic</h5>
Pictures coming soon... <small>of our second kills</small>

<h5>Good News!</h5>
We were doing Socrethar <span class="label label-danger">all wrong</span>.
The buffs the Dominator got a few weeks ago changed how the boss is done. We were able to ignore most of it because he is overly easy on normal but we can't do it on heroic. It is very possible to do stay in phase 2 throughout the fight but with the mentioned buffs, it is safer to do a controlled transition back to phase 1. Check the guide below.
