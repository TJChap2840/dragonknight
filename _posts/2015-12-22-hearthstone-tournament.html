title: Hearthstone Tournament and updates

<h5>Hearthstone Info</h5>
I am happy to announce the start of a new guild Hearthstone tournament series. The tournament date is still TBD but will occur sometime in the middle of January. All guild members (and their friends) are encouraged to sign up. You can find more info by clicking on the Hearthstone banner at the top of the page or going to <a href="/hearthstone/">this</a> link. Contact Brisp/Bigchap if you'd like to participate.

<h5>Raid Update</h5>
We've made solid progress on Mythic given our limited raid schedule. We are currently 3/13 Mythic and very close to 4/13. We are always looking to add more raiders to our roster. Message one of the people on the  <a href="/about/">about</a> or one of the officers in game. 

<h5>Various Site Additions</h5>
I've also taken some time to make some more updates to the website. Most notably, I have added a stream status section to the right side of the homepage. Clicking on a users status will also take you directly to their stream page. I will be adding more features to this shortly, but I am shifting my focus to the <a href="/hearthstone/">Hearthstone tournament</a> for now.
