To start things off, I want to metion again the guides that Marsh and I wrote. The steps in those guides are very simple to do and should immediately show results. They were created for your benefit. That said, the better you do, the better your raid does. It is a win-win for everybody.

We were able to kill 3 new heroic bosses last week before Shiftless and Marsh went on vacation. That put us at 11/13h and we are very close to a heroic Mannoroth kill. As part of the success, Cenderi, Dad, and Mistytide have been added to the raid team. Make sure to congratulate them!

We are still in great need of a Disc Priest and back up tank. Please let one of the officers know if you are interested. You'll need to be able to raid Tuesday-Thursday from 7:30 to 10 server.

Also, for anybody interested, FinalBossTV releases weekly episodes that focus on end game raiding. Each episode features guest from top ranked guilds. Their catalog provides a ton detailed information for each spec and class. Some of the older episodes might be outdated but they've recently started a series called <b><em>Warlords of Ketchup</em></b>. The series provides a high level overview of raiding in HFC and is a great resource. Everybody interested in raiding should watch these. Here is a link to the most recent:
