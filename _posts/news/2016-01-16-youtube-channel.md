##Youtube Channel
I have created a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8BXVlTC8SiL3Y_NIXQpnzg)to help consolidate the recordings of the tournament matches. You can find them all at the link provided or on the new social button added to the website's navbar. The youtube channel won't be just for the Hearthstone tournament. Any fun Dragon Knight content going forward will be added to that channel so be sure to check back regularly.

##Honorable Kill Event
It's a good time to announce our next event now that the Hearthstone tournament has started.
The event will be held on the Bonus Honor weekend and will have one simple rule. Get the most honorable kills over the course of that weekend. To make sure everybody has a fair shot, each contestant's current HK amount will be recorded as the event starts. When the event is over, HK amounts will be recorded again. Whoever has the biggest difference between the two amounts will be crowned champion. I'll put an event up for that weekend for you guys to sign up on.

##Mythic Gorefiend CAN SUCK IT
As our raid time was coming to an end on Tuesday night, the raid team decided to rally together and try one more pull. Everything clicked in that pull and we were able to down Kilrogg. Great job everybody. We took a strat and made it work for our raid team and it paid off. Very well done.

On Wednesday, we started Gorefiend (aka "the guild killer"). Talk about a a well designed nightmare. Everybody has to be absolutely perfect with mechanics to kill this boss. Please continue researching the fight so we can go into the next progression night much better off.
