title: Let's Prepare for Mythic
---

<h3>New Raid Schedule</h3>
<p>Monday is typically an off night but we try to use it for more progression attempts whenever raiders are available. Part of the reason we needed the extra night for progression was that we were using one of our main nights as a gearing night. We have decided to switch the schedule up a bit and make Monday a gearing night while using Tues-Thur purely for progression. For everybody involved in raiding, I need you to check your guild calendar and make sure you respond. I need to have a good idea of who is planning on coming. Not replying at all gives me no info. If you accept an invite, I better see you in the raid unless you give somebody advanced noticed whenever possible.</p>

<b>What that means for Dragon Knight:</b>
<p>Monday will be an open sign up night for anybody geared enough to raid in Normal HFC. That does not mean that you can expect to get carried. We fully expect you to pull your weight unless you talk to Bigchap, Tresane, Marsh, or Dragonheart. This night is also important because it gives the officers an opportunity to gear new raiders for composition reasons.</p>

<h3>LFM</h3>
<p>The main raid team is looking for a solid back up tank. Ideally you are already raiding with us. If not, you'll need to be capable of DPSing as we can't carry a 3rd undergeared tank through raids. </p>
<p>We are also looking for a Disc Priest. Unfortunately, Disc Priests are almost mandatory for end game content and we are reaching a point where one is much needed. Don't worry if you are not geared yet (that is what Monday nights are for).</p>

<h3>Getting Ready for Mythic</h3>
<p>We still have quite a bit of Heroic left to get through but the officers are starting work on selecting a Mythic team. Any selections already made are not set in stone but our raiders interested in Mythic content should strive to get better at their spec. Marsh wrote a great guide (see the big red bar) on how to do that and everybody should be using it. A good place to start are the <a href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/7zngxKXQPAZhTDwN#fight=5&view=rankings">Warcraft Log Rankings</a>. Some people are just having a bad fight and others are consistently "in the grey". We'd like for all of our DPS to be able to rank AT LEAST 50% (preferably higher) for their ilvl bracket.</p>
<p>The officers will do their best to identify people who need help but it is ultimately up to you to start asking questions. Ask somebody if you don't know where to look. The only thing worse than a person who can't DPS is a person who can't DPS and doesn't care to get better.</p>

<h3>How Are We Doing?</h3>
<p>We did a great job last night killing Archimonde. We had a lot of new people step in and step up to the challenges I gave them. As of Thursday night we are 7/13 Heroic and should be downing Fel Lord very soon. Let's be on our game this week. The sooner we clear Heroic the sooner we can be killing Mythic bosses.</p>
