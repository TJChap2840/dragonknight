title: Valor is Back

Prepare yourself for 6.2.3 if you are looking to get a maximum of 10 more ilvls out from your current gear. 

You can get up 4875 Valor per week. Which means you can give +10 ilvls to 9 of your items in one week.

* You get 300 Valor per Mythic dungeon (2400 for all 8)
* 500 for the weekly Event quest (excluding Pet Battle)
* 100 Valor for your first random Heroic (700 total)
* 750 for completing all of HFC LFR, 300 for completing all of BRF LFR, and 225 for completing all of HM LFR

Assuming you don't do LFR (because fuck LFR), that will give you 3600 Valor or 6 items in one week. That's a huge lift and will help us push through Mythic content faster.

Also, Mythic warforged can be as high as ilvl 725.

All of that to say that everybody should be trying to knock that content out. I expect a lot of our guild will be trying to do this so don't hesitate to make 5 mans. Helping other guild members get their Valor helps you as well.
