title: Loot Priority and BIS Lists
---

There will be some loot rule changes with the upcoming tier to streamline the progression process.

I am working on Best in Slot lists for everybody in our raid group. These lists will be a resource for you and used as a tool for the officers to be able to hand out loot. A person will get priority if the item is BIS for them. If the item is BIS for more than one person, the item will go to a roll (with biggest iLvl upgrade being accounted for).

There will also be a tier priority as some people get much more value out of their tier bonuses than others do (RIP Fury Warrior). This also applies to class trinkets.

Talk to Brisp if you have any questions.
