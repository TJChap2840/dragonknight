title: It's almost TIMEEEE

Tomorrow night is Hellfire Citadel time. In preparation for the raid, I'd like everybody to meet at my garrison just before we go to the instance. Since we can fly to the raid from our garrisons I'd like everybody to <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=119093/avianas-feather">Aviana'a Feather</a> to the instance together and take selfies as we go. We will get a lot of quality pics that I'd like to add to the site. Remember, the motto for this tier is to <span class="label label-success">have fun</span>. Everything I have done has been done with that in mind. 

I've spent the weekend putting together some resources for the site that I am going to expand upon over the next week or so. I think the biggest thing to focus on are the BIS lists I have created for most of the specs in our raid group. There is a [Best in Slot](http://dk.chapley.com/best_in_slot/) page up with item lists that pull tool tips from wowhead. I've also created a large google doc that you can use for your own notes.
