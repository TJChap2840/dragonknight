title: Get Some Sleep Flarez (and Mythic Updates)
---
<h5>Honorable Kill Event</h5>
<p>Flarez has come out on top after a long weekend of killing Horde. He proved that with hardwork and dedication, your dreams of winning a Dragon Knight guild event can come true. Overall the event was a huge successm, but the format could probably use a little work. Feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions.</p>
