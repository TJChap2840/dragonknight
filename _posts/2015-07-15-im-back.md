Great job while I was gone. The only concern I had was us being low on tanks, but I've heard that Vert did a great job stepping in. The last thing I want to do is mess up the groove after missing 4 raid nights so I'll do my best to fit in with what you guys have been doing while I was away. 

Next week though I'd like to do down H Iron Reaver. I've been reading that we should easily be able to kill the first 4 Heroic bosses. Those Heroic pieces will go a long way to help us kill the last two bosses in Normal. It will also set us up to be ahead of the curve for when we start working on the remaining Heroic bosses. I won't let this get in the way of our progression in Normal. We may just replace the first 4 Normal bosses with a few attempts on Heroic bosses since we can skip past Gorefiend in Normal now.
