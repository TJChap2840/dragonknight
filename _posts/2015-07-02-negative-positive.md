title: Less Negativity, More Positivity

<h4><u>Thanks Tresane</u></h4>
Everybody thank Tresane for taking a little time out of his day to clean up the site a bit and add some color. I tried to add some color but I'm not very good at it and it looked terrible. 

<h4><u>On to the raid talk</u></h4>
I'd like to welcome our new additions to the raid team. We've had quite a few new people interested in raiding with us and I think it is a great thing. Incorporating them will have its challenges but I think it will be good for our team and guild in the end! 

Negativity and complaints have started to pop up here and there. I know these are minor in the grand scheme of things but I want to get out ahead of them before they turn into something bigger. Let's please keep the overall vibe of the raid positive and fun. We have to continue to work as a team if we want to down more bosses and get more loot. I fully understand that people may have differences of opinions but ultimately the decision will come down to what is better for the raid and the negativity doesn't help in anyway. If you get called out or are calling somebody out, please be constructive about it. Taking things to personally doesn't help. If you see somebody that needs help, help them, don't yell at them.

That leads into my next topic. Please do not get frustrated when an item is looted to somebody automatically or given to them even if your roll won. This is progression and it helps the ENTIRE raid if the right loot goes to the right people. This won't always happen and the balance may be hard to find at first, but it is for the good of the raid. The same idea goes for tier pieces. I have touched on this multiple times, but it does the raid no good if you are trying to get your 2pc/4pc just for the sake of having it. That is doubly so if you don't know what benefit you will get out of your set bonuses. If anything, passing the piece to somebody who gets more benefit out of it only helps you get your full set quicker because we will be downing bosses quicker. 

As far as composition goes, it's time to start thinking about what we can do better. We have too many people on the same token. Even if we ignore tokens we are starting to get too many of the same classes. It would be a big help to me if people would consider switching to fill gaps. Gearing out alts is extremely easy now via Timewalking dungeons, Baleful gear, and Mythic dungeons. This also goes for people who are not having as much fun on their chosen spec/class or if you are unable to get your DPS numbers up to the right level. Plenty of us will help you gear alts. It's not fair to the raid or yourself if you just show up as a warm body and do nothing else. Others are putting in hard work and I'd hate to see that hard work go to waste. Keep in mind that people will start getting rewarded for helping out other raid members.

Finally, please try and stick with the plan. There are plenty of valid reasons for moving to heroic and I'll try to compromise on that, but we are getting ahead of ourselves if we think we can leave normal completely behind for heroic while we continue to struggle on normal bosses.
