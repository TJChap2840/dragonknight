title: Suggestion for the site and kudos on the boss kills
---

First of all, yes, I know the site doesn't look *AMAZING* but my background is development, not design. I'm always game for help or suggestions. 

Below is a list of planned content. Let me know if you have suggestions for more.

* Warcraft Logs Feed
* Guild picture section
* Comment support (probably not a forums)

## We are 7/13N!

Excellent job so far. Everybody has kept it <span class="label label-success">light-hearted</span> but also <span class="label label-warning">serious</span> when we needed it. It's great that you are all chiming in for on-the-fly adjustments. It takes a lot of stress off of me as raid leader and makes the overall attitude better as well.

Tonight we will be going to Socrethar, Tyrant Velhari, and then Fel Lord. The difficulty will continue to ramp up as we go further into the instance. Not only because the bosses will be harder but the ilvl requirement goes up as well. 

Here is a picture for a boss order guide if you would like to know the general direction we will be going.
