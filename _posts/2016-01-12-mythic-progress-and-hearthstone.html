<h5>Mythic Progress</h5>
<p>We've been making good progress since my last post on this topic. We now have Hellfire Council on farm and are trying to make progress on Kilrogg. We haven't had a lot of opportunities because we have had poor turn out on Wednesday and Thursday nights. Tuesday's turn out has been great, but we have had to use Tuesday to clear farm. Our attendance needs to be more consistent or we will have to make some changes to our roster.</p>

<h5>Decks Needed!</h5>
<p>I am still missing decks and/or entry fees from the names below:
<b>Ghains, Pallypower, Skifree, Nocturnel</b>

Please get these to me as soon as possible so that I can set a schedule. I also need to know if you do not plan on playing anymore so that can back fill as possible. This event is intended to be for fun, but that doesn't mean there isn't preperations to be made to make it happen.</p>
