<h3>Quick Update</h3>
<p>Heroic Archimonde down. On to Mythic.

Haven't updated in while as not much really changed. We made fairly quick progress through Heroic (up to Archimonde) and took a short break as people were getting burnt out.

Since then, we've merged with a great raid team from Spectre that instantly provided a bunch of value to Dragon Knight. They learned heroic strats very quickly and meshed well with what we were moving towards.</p>

<h3>Mythic!</h3>
With their help, we've downed Archimonde and we are moving to Mythic.

Here are the guides you should study for tonight.

<h3>Raid Team</h3>
I've also updated the raid team list as we've had a bunch of people come and go. Damitus (our new officer and Prot Paladin) did a great job reaching out to our raiders to confirm who was joining us for Mythic.
