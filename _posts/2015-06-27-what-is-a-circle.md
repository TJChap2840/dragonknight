## We are now 9/13

After a rough start with a quite a few wipes on trash, Dragon Knight persevered and killed two more bosses. Socrethar was a joke and we only wiped the first time because the Construct's abilities weren't immediately clear to me. Tyrant was on a whole other level but we did a great job taking it step by step. Everybody did a great job listening both before fights and in fights. Keep it up! Our goal for next week is to kill the bosses up to Tyrant on Tuesday and then move on to the pre-Mannoroth bosses on Wednesday.

Shout out to Bruce (aka Sapphyra) and Dawnguard. Bruce and Dawnguard have both recently joined our raid (hopefully permanently) and did a great job stepping up when we needed them. Great DPS Bruce and thanks for going Holy for us Dawnguard.

Make sure you guys ask Crians what a circle is as he should certainly know by now.
