<h5>Progression Update</h5>
As of Wednesday night, we are 12.5/13 normal and 5/13 heroic. Really good job overall guys. Attendance has been great and the attitude of the raid has been good.

Congratulations to Enide, who has officially been added to the <a href="/raid_team/">raid team</a>. He has consistently shown up to raids and is doing a great job as our main Resto Shaman. We have two other new (or newish) members that are doing a great job fitting in and meshing well with the DK style of raiding. Smites and Cenderi have already show a great attitude towards the overall raid and loot rules. Keep up the good work all.

I know there isn't 100% satisifaction with the way tier pieces are going out, but I'm doing it with the raid in mind. Let me know if you have any concerns and I will see what I can do, but this really is the best and quickest way.

Keep up the good work all!

<h5>Website Update</h5>
I've done a ton of work to the site today. Some things you guys won't ever see so I won't go into those, but there are plenty of things you will.

First of all, I have added a feed for the latest Warcraft Log posts!!! I'm extremely happy about this one. You'll see it just below the MMOC feed on the left. Right now it shows the last 5 logs posted to the guild calendar. Clicking on the item will take you to the log. It will get cleaned up a bit and made to look better as time goes on (calling Tresane). 

I have also added discussions via Disqus. I recommend you make an account, but I have set it up to allow guests to post as well. Each post will have a comment section and I think that you can go to a "forum" of sorts that will have all the activity on one page. I don't know for sure as I am still figuring out the features of Disqus.
