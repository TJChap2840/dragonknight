<p>What does it mean to be a Dragon Knight one might ask? What it means being a part of a community of friends who deliver Justice with a capital J across many mediums. While our main struggle exists in the World of Warcraft, members may find themselves doing battle in a myriad of other games including Overwatch, Hearthstone and TableTop Simulator. Dragon Knight hosts a number of guild events outside of WoW including the renown seasonal Hearthstone Winner-take-all tournament.</p>

<p>Whether you are into competitive WoW Raiding or seek a community of friends who play a host of games, Dragon Knight is the right place for you.</p>
