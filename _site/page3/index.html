            <h3>New Raid Schedule</h3>


<p>Monday is typically an off night but we try to use it for more progression attempts whenever raiders are available. Part of the reason we needed the extra night for progression was that we were using one of our main nights as a gearing night. We have decided to switch the schedule up a bit and make Monday a gearing night while using Tues-Thur purely for progression. For everybody involved in raiding, I need you to check your guild calendar and make sure you respond. I need to have a good idea of who is planning on coming. Not replying at all gives me no info. If you accept an invite, I better see you in the raid unless you give somebody advanced noticed whenever possible.</p>


<p><b>What that means for Dragon Knight:</b></p>

<p>Monday will be an open sign up night for anybody geared enough to raid in Normal HFC. That does not mean that you can expect to get carried. We fully expect you to pull your weight unless you talk to Bigchap, Tresane, Marsh, or Dragonheart. This night is also important because it gives the officers an opportunity to gear new raiders for composition reasons.</p>




<h3>LFM</h3>


<p>The main raid team is looking for a solid back up tank. Ideally you are already raiding with us. If not, you'll need to be capable of DPSing as we can't carry a 3rd undergeared tank through raids. </p>


<p>We are also looking for a Disc Priest. Unfortunately, Disc Priests are almost mandatory for end game content and we are reaching a point where one is much needed. Don't worry if you are not geared yet (that is what Monday nights are for).</p>




<h3>Getting Ready for Mythic</h3>


<p>We still have quite a bit of Heroic left to get through but the officers are starting work on selecting a Mythic team. Any selections already made are not set in stone but our raiders interested in Mythic content should strive to get better at their spec. Marsh wrote a great guide (see the big red bar) on how to do that and everybody should be using it. A good place to start are the <a href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/7zngxKXQPAZhTDwN#fight=5&view=rankings">Warcraft Log Rankings</a>. Some people are just having a bad fight and others are consistently "in the grey". We'd like for all of our DPS to be able to rank AT LEAST 50% (preferably higher) for their ilvl bracket.</p>


<p>The officers will do their best to identify people who need help but it is ultimately up to you to start asking questions. Ask somebody if you don't know where to look. The only thing worse than a person who can't DPS is a person who can't DPS and doesn't care to get better.</p>




<h3>How Are We Doing?</h3>


<p>We did a great job last night killing Archimonde. We had a lot of new people step in and step up to the challenges I gave them. As of Thursday night we are 7/13 Heroic and should be downing Fel Lord very soon. Let's be on our game this week. The sooner we clear Heroic the sooner we can be killing Mythic bosses.</p>

<h3>Welcome Resolve Members</h3>


<p>Dragon Knight has recently completed a small merger with some members of Resolve. This is excellent news for everybody involved. The Resolve members get to join a group pushing heroic content and Dragon Knight get to add some key members to its core raid team. This will give us the ability to get into mythic content once the time comes. Rarrox, Resolve's raid leader, has been made an officer as part of the merger. He is doing a great job fitting in and has been a much needed resource. All the other members of Resolve have meshed with us well and I hope to continue to make them feel like part of our guild.</p>

<h3>We are now 13/13n</h3>


<p>10 or so Dragon Knight members got together on Saturday for a spur of the moment PUG group. This group was a huge success and we were able to kill <span class="label label-success">NORMAL ARCHIMONDE</span>. Of course our very own Marshboa gets his much deserved class trinket.</p>

<h3>Raid News</h3>


<p>With a full guild Archimonde kill in sight, we will be shifting our progression focus to him. With that in mind, I'm going to push us hard to get Archimonde attempts in on Tuesday night. We are still going to have fun, but we need to be in control as we clear the instance. We will start as close to 7:30 as possible so <span class="label label-warning">be on time</span>.</p>

<p>As for heroic progression, we are going to move away from Socrethar and go the proper path of Iskar > Fel Lord > Socrethar. I incorrectly took us to the Socrethar first and we will correct that this week. Apologies.</p>

<p>We've had a recent influx of new members and we're getting to a point where we desperately need people to start thinking about switching specs or classes. The last thing I want people to do is to stop having fun raiding with us, and if you only have fun playing your one class then stick with it. If there is another class you also enjoy, think about switching (as long as we could use that class). I'm talking about this now rather than later becaue we need to start getting your alts geared if you intend to switch. We don't want to be heading into mythic and realize we need to gear up another alt.</p>

<h3>Just How Bad am I? A Guide to DPS & Warcraft Logs</h3>


<p><a class="btn btn-default" href="/log_guide/" role="button">Go to guide</a></p>

<p>Marsh has written up an awesome guide to help everybody get better at their class. I've created a page on out website in the resources section and will temporarily have a banner at the top so people can quickly access the guide and get up to speed. I strongly encourage everybody to take a look at this. The biggest thing about being "bad" is that you may not know you are bad. This will help you get an idea of where you stand.</p>

<p>Pictures coming soon... <small>of our second kills</small></p>

<h4>Good News!</h4>


<p>We were doing Socrethar <span class="label label-danger">all wrong</span>.
The buffs the Dominator got a few weeks ago changed how the boss is done. We were able to ignore most of it because he is overly easy on normal but we can't do it on heroic. It is very possible to do stay in phase 2 throughout the fight but with the mentioned buffs, it is safer to do a controlled transition back to phase 1. Check the guide below.</p>
