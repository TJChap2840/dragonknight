  <h2>Learn Your Class. A Guide to DPS & Warcraft Logs Pt. 2</h2>
<h5>by: Bigchap</h5>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><a href="/log_guide/"><b>Click here for part 1</b></a></div>

<p>So you have realized that you have room to improve in your chosen spec and class. As mentioned before, you should stop by sites like <a href="http://icy-veins.com">icy-veins.com</a> to get a general idea of your rotation. But let's assume that you've done that and you are still struggling to maximize your DPS. What do you do next? This guide will dive into some more features of <a href="http://warcraftlogs.com">Warcraft Logs</a> to give you that extra bit.</p>

<p>For this guide, I'll be using Jackshephard as an example. Jackshephard recently switched mains from Zomgqq to help the raid and is still getting used to the new rotation. The steps I will go over in this guide, Jackshephard is already practicing.</p>

<p>To start, select a fight where you see some room for improvement. <div class="well">I've selected a <a href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/k23f9LKqYBhDjdZy#fight=8">recent</a> Heroic Gorefiend kill as an example for Jackshephard. This particular fight will be used throughout the guide.</div> Once you have selected the fight, find a comparable log of someone who parsed well in your ilvl bracket with your spec. Go to zone rankings:</p>
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <a class="gif" href="http://i.imgur.com/Exjo3Pz.png"><img class="gif embed-responsive-item" src="http://i.imgur.com/Exjo3Pz.png" /></a>
</div>
<br/>

<p>You can further customize the list that appears by using the dropdowns at the top:</p>
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <a class="gif" href="http://i.imgur.com/X5tKJO4.png"><img class="gif embed-responsive-item" src="http://i.imgur.com/X5tKJO4.png" /></a>
</div>
<br/>

<div class="well">To get a better comparison, try to find a fight with as close to the same raid size and fight length as possible.</div>

<p>Now that we have two fights to compare, let's start using the many many tools at our disposal.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Self Buffs</b> - This is the easiest place to start as most, if not all, specs have some sort of self buff with a suggested uptime (usually 100%). In the case of Combat Rogue, Jackshephard should have a near 100% uptime on <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=5171/slice-and-dice">Slice and Dice</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=152152/venom-rush">Venom Rush</a>.</p>
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <a class="gif" href="http://i.imgur.com/rtYkJzH.png"><img class="gif embed-responsive-item" src="http://i.imgur.com/rtYkJzH.png" /></a>
</div>
<br/>

<p>In this particular fight, he did a great job with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=152152/venom-rush">Venom Rush</a> but is losing a lot of uptime on his <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=5171/slice-and-dice">Slice and Dice</a>. As a solution, he is going to build a WeakAura, to constantly remind him to refresh <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=5171/slice-and-dice">Slice and Dice</a>. After a while of using that WeakAura, it will become habit and he should be able to maximize the buff time with ease.
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Ability Usage</b> - The next step is to look at your ability usage. There are a lot of variables at play when doing this comparison, but you should be able to get a good idea of what you are doing wrong (or right). <div class="well">Things like set bonuses, trinkets, talent selection play a big part of your rotation. Sometimes you won't be able to get ability usage to match because of that but it does give you an idea of what to target for future fights.</div></p>
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <a class="gif" href="http://i.imgur.com/E3DO4JP.png"><img class="gif embed-responsive-item" src="http://i.imgur.com/E3DO4JP.png" /></a>
</div>
<br/>
<p>In this case, Jackshephard did a great job with his rotation. One key difference is that Jackshephard has <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=165478/item-rogue-t17-combat-4p-bonus">T17 4pc</a> while Twoshankz has <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=186288/item-rogue-t18-combat-4p-bonus">T18 4pc</a>. T17 4pc gives <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=2098/eviscerate">Eviscerate</a> procs which could explain his high usage relative to Twoshankz. Extra GCDs used on Eviscerate will lower the available GCDs for <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1752/sinister-strike">Sinister Strike</a>.</p>
</li>

<li><p><b>Cast Order</b> - This is more of an advanced, niche feature, but you'll want to start looking at this if you are <b>REALLY</b> trying to get the most out of your class. A common problem area for many people is their fight opener as well as their opener for major phases within the fight. Openers are a very crucial part of getting the most DPS you can and fixing them will go a long way for you. I've posted a picture as an example and you can ask me in game or on Skype for more detail or specific examples.</p>
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <a class="gif" href="http://i.imgur.com/ip9J0cZ.png"><img class="gif embed-responsive-item" src="http://i.imgur.com/ip9J0cZ.png" /></a>
</div>
<br/>
</ol>

<p>Overall Jackshephard is doing the right things and knows what to fix. Fixes like buff uptime, T18 4pc, and <b>USING AGILITY POTS</b> are easily obtainable. Doing log analyses like this do not take very long and will make you noticably better at your spec. As always, be sure to ask if you need help. It shows effort to improve.</p>
