<h3>Welcome Resolve Members</h3>


<p>Dragon Knight has recently completed a small merger with some members of Resolve. This is excellent news for everybody involved. The Resolve members get to join a group pushing heroic content and Dragon Knight get to add some key members to its core raid team. This will give us the ability to get into mythic content once the time comes. Rarrox, Resolve's raid leader, has been made an officer as part of the merger. He is doing a great job fitting in and has been a much needed resource. All the other members of Resolve have meshed with us well and I hope to continue to make them feel like part of our guild.</p>

<h3>We are now 13/13n</h3>


<p>10 or so Dragon Knight members got together on Saturday for a spur of the moment PUG group. This group was a huge success and we were able to kill <span class="label label-success">NORMAL ARCHIMONDE</span>. Of course our very own Marshboa gets his much deserved class trinket.</p>

<h3>Raid News</h3>


<p>With a full guild Archimonde kill in sight, we will be shifting our progression focus to him. With that in mind, I'm going to push us hard to get Archimonde attempts in on Tuesday night. We are still going to have fun, but we need to be in control as we clear the instance. We will start as close to 7:30 as possible so <span class="label label-warning">be on time</span>.</p>

<p>As for heroic progression, we are going to move away from Socrethar and go the proper path of Iskar > Fel Lord > Socrethar. I incorrectly took us to the Socrethar first and we will correct that this week. Apologies.</p>

<p>We've had a recent influx of new members and we're getting to a point where we desperately need people to start thinking about switching specs or classes. The last thing I want people to do is to stop having fun raiding with us, and if you only have fun playing your one class then stick with it. If there is another class you also enjoy, think about switching (as long as we could use that class). I'm talking about this now rather than later becaue we need to start getting your alts geared if you intend to switch. We don't want to be heading into mythic and realize we need to gear up another alt.</p>

<h3>Just How Bad am I? A Guide to DPS & Warcraft Logs</h3>


<p><a class="btn btn-default" href="/log_guide/" role="button">Go to guide</a></p>

<p>Marsh has written up an awesome guide to help everybody get better at their class. I've created a page on out website in the resources section and will temporarily have a banner at the top so people can quickly access the guide and get up to speed. I strongly encourage everybody to take a look at this. The biggest thing about being "bad" is that you may not know you are bad. This will help you get an idea of where you stand.</p>
